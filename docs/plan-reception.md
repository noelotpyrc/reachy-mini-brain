# Reachy Mini — Clinic Reception Robot Plan

> A standalone, always-on "reception guy" for a clinic front desk:
> toggleable vision (always-on monitoring + alerts) and toggleable voice
> (human-controlled conversation). This document is the design of record for
> that build. It supersedes the generic Phase 5–7 sketch in `plan.md` for
> the reception use case.

## Use case

The robot sits at a clinic front desk and does two **independent**, separately
toggled jobs:

- **Vision (toggle on/off):** when on, it continuously watches the scene,
  identifies people/objects, and a *separate* process decides whether to raise
  an alert (someone arrived, an unattended item, someone waiting too long…).
- **Voice (toggle on/off):** when on, a human switches it into conversation
  mode and it talks to real people — greeting, answering questions, directions,
  FAQ — using an agentic LLM as its brain, with expressive motion.

Both can be on at once (sees *and* talks) or independently.

---

## The core reframe

Phases 1–4 of this project were built on one assumption: **Claude Code is the
brain, with a human (or a spawned `cla` agent) in the loop.** The CLIs are
fire-and-forget — connect, act, exit — and the intelligence is a developer
typing, or a short-lived agent reacting to a trigger.

A reception robot is the opposite: **always-on, unattended, no developer at the
keyboard.** That flips the architecture from *"Claude Code drives the robot"* to
*"a resident daemon owns the robot and embeds the intelligence in its own
loop."*

The project was built in two halves, and only the top half changes:

- **Bottom half (hardware abstraction)** — `robot.py`, `session.py`, WebRTC
  capture, STT/TTS — was deliberately built SDK-independent and persistent. This
  is exactly the substrate an always-on daemon needs. **Heavy reuse.**
- **Top half (the brain)** — Claude-Code-as-driver and the `cla`-spawn meeting
  trigger — does not transfer (too slow: ~15–18s cold start; too costly:
  ~$0.13/turn; depends on the dev tool being present). **Replaced** by a
  standalone controller with an agentic LLM brain.

---

## Decisions (resolved)

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| **Brain runtime** | Standalone resident daemon + an **agentic** LLM layer (not bare stateless API calls). Conversation needs durable state + tool use across turns. Target: Claude Agent SDK embedded in the daemon. |
| **Vision processing** | Tiered, **fully local**: a cheap detector runs continuously as a tripwire; escalates to a **small local VLM** on meaningful events. |
| **Compute host** | **Mac stays tethered.** Robot on the RPi 5; daemon, models, and brain on the Mac over the LAN. Nothing to port for now. |
| **Privacy posture** | Raw audio/video **stays local**. Only **text** (transcripts, scene descriptions) crosses to the cloud. The local VLM choice keeps frames in the building. |
| **Robot ↔ Mac network** | **Same LAN, deliberately** (see Networking). Tailscale is for remote *control* of the daemon, not for the media path. |

---

## Two "sessions" — do not conflate

The daemon must own **two** long-lived things. The existing code solves only one:

1. **Hardware session** — the live `ReachyMini()` / WebRTC connection (camera,
   mic, speaker). ✅ Already solved by `session.py` (one instance, channels kept
   warm, continuous-listen buffer, thread-safe audio push).
2. **Conversation session** — the agent's running message history + tool state,
   so turn 5 remembers turn 1 and can call "look up appointment." ❌ Does not
   exist yet. This is the "agentic AI api." A bare LLM endpoint is stateless and
   cannot *be* a conversation; the agent layer holds this.

The reception daemon owns both.

## Architecture (tethered Mac)

```
        Reachy Mini (RPi 5) ── camera · mic · speaker · motors
              ↕ WiFi  (REST :8000  +  WebRTC :8443)   [same LAN]
 ┌──────────────────── Mac (always on) ─────────────────────┐

 └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↕  text only (transcripts, scene descriptions)
                          Claude API
```

Perception and alerting are **separate processes**: perception emits structured
events; the alert engine consumes them and owns the alert policy. Perception
does not know the policy.

---

## Networking — does the robot need the same WiFi as the Mac?

Two transports, two answers:

- **REST / motors / state (port 8000)** — *not* bound to same WiFi. `robot.py`
  reads `REACHY_HOST` (default `reachy-mini.local`, an **mDNS** name that only
  resolves on the same LAN). Point it at a raw IP / Tailscale name and REST works
  over anything routable.
- **Camera / mic / speaker — WebRTC (port 8443)** — *effectively* same-LAN
  today. Every `ReachyMini()` is constructed with **no hostname argument**
  (SDK default discovery), and WebRTC negotiates media over ICE host candidates
  that assume direct reachability. Off-LAN traversal is unconfigured and the SDK
  host isn't parameterized in our code.

**For this build:** keep robot and Mac on the **same LAN/subnet**. It's the
reliable, low-latency, all-local path — and it matches the "media stays local"
privacy choice.

- **Gotcha:** AP client isolation / guest WiFi blocks device-to-device traffic
  and breaks both mDNS and WebRTC. Use a non-isolated network/VLAN. (Mac on
  Ethernet + robot on WiFi of the *same router* = same subnet = fine.)
- **Tailscale:** great for **remote control** of the daemon (toggle vision/voice
  from a phone over the tailnet). Do **not** route the robot↔Mac media over it.

## Reuse map

| Existing | For the reception robot |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `robot.py` (REST, motors, lifecycle) | ✅ Keep as-is — the motor/daemon layer |
| `session.py` (live `ReachyMini()`, continuous listen, socket server, thread-safe audio) | ✅ The backbone — the hardware-session primitive |
| `vision.py` (WebRTC frame capture) | ✅ Keep the *capture*; new *processing* on top |
| `stt.py` / `tts.py` / `audio.py` | ✅ Reuse listen/speak; reconsider STT model (the "Reachy" mishear issue) |
| `motion.py` (look/nod/scan) | ✅ Reuse as a behavior library (greet, track speaker, idle scan) |
| `transcribe.py` (bg loop + trigger + `cla` dispatch) | ⚠️ Reuse the *pattern* (background perception loop); retire `cla` dispatch |
| Claude-Code-as-brain | ❌ Replaced by the standalone daemon + agentic LLM |

---

## Build plan

Each phase is independently demoable. B and C share only the daemon from A, so
they can proceed in parallel once A lands.

- **A — Reception daemon + control plane.** ✅ **DONE — validated on hardware
  2026-06-04** (see "Phase A — result" below). Promote the session into a resident
  daemon with two independent toggles as a state machine. Pure plumbing &
  lifecycle; replaces "Claude Code drives it." *(Detailed below.)*
- **B — Vision pipeline + alerting (two processes).** ✅ **code-complete; mock +
  real-video validated, live test pending** (see "Phase B — result"). Perception:
  frame → RF-DETR Nano person detector → ByteTrack + approach geometry → events.
  A **separate** alert engine consumes the events and tells the robot to greet.
- **C — Voice brain (standalone).** ✅ **code-complete; mock + text validated, live
  test pending** (see "Phase C — result"). Continuous listen → STT → `claude -p`
  agent (receptionist persona + session memory) → TTS → speak. Robot-expression
  tools + an authoritative FAQ tool deferred.
- **D — Fuse.** Vision events feed the voice brain (greet on approach,
  "you've been waiting — someone's coming").
- **E — Productionize.** Auto-restart, logging, privacy handling, monitoring,
  optional Tailscale control endpoint.

## Testing strategy — semi-live (video) → live (robot)

Two stages, cheapest first. **Do not burn a live robot session to test logic a video
can exercise** — we learned this hand-tuning approach thresholds in real time.

**Stage 1 — Semi-live (video-driven).** Feed a recorded video into the perception
pipeline in place of the live camera; the full chain runs identically
(detect → track → approach → event → react). `perception.process(frame)` is already
source-agnostic (validated ~23 fps on `reachy_video.mp4`), so this only needs a
frame-source switch (camera vs file). Two sub-modes:
- **Assert mode** (no robot, dev venv / CI) — a library of *labelled scenario clips*,
  each with an expected event count = a regression suite for the perception + approach
  logic. Tune thresholds against these, not against the robot:
  - `approach.mp4` → expect **1** approach event
  - `walk-by.mp4` (transit across frame) → expect **0**
  - `sitting-fidget.mp4` (stationary person moving hands/head) → expect **0**  ← a real false-positive we hit live
  - `two-people.mp4`, `empty.mp4` → expected counts
- **Robot-reacts mode** (robot present, video input) — e.g. `serve --perception
  --video clip.mp4`: the real robot greets in response to the clip, exercising motion +
  audio against *reproducible* vision input (decouples "did approach fire" from "did the
  robot react").

**Gate:** scenarios must pass in Stage 1 before spending a live session.

**Stage 2 — Live (robot + real camera).** Only what genuinely needs hardware: real
framing, motion, audio playback over WebRTC/WiFi, network. Captured in
[`live-test-log.md`](./live-test-log.md) (good / ugly / bad).

### Eval framework — auto-labeled regression loop (the debug/improv flow)

Hand-tuning thresholds + eyeballing live runs doesn't scale. The repeatable loop, designed
so a **model labels and a human only verifies** (never hand-labels):

1. **Record** — daemon `record` + `capture` → paired `video-*.mkv` (crash-resilient) +
   `capture-*.jsonl` + `events.jsonl` + durable log. The video is ground truth: replay
   reproduces the live run deterministically (same frames in → same events out).
2. **Annotate** — `replay --annotate` burns frame numbers + boxes + dom_area + visit-state +
   event flashes onto the clip — the review aid for verifying labels.
3. **Auto-label** — a model proposes ground-truth segments by frame range
   (`approach / leave / present / pass-by / empty / wave`) → `<clip>.labels.json`; a human
   only **verifies** (review-speed). Each segment carries `expect` (must fire) / `forbid`
   (must not) so the score catches both non-fires and misfires.
   - **Labeler:** Claude vision (API) for our *own* dev clips — strongest, zero install.
     A **local VLM** (Qwen2.5-VL / Moondream) is the privacy-safe swap-in **required** for
     any patient/production footage (raw video stays local — see Privacy posture).
4. **Score** — `reception-score <clip> <labels>` replays the clip (frame-indexed events),
   compares fired vs labels per segment → MISFIRE / NON-FIRE / correct, with frame refs +
   precision/recall per event type.
5. **Iterate** — every labeled clip becomes a regression test; a logic change (depart
   robustness, `DetectionsSmoother`, wave threshold) must cut misfire/non-fire rates without
   breaking what passed.

Status: framework agreed; `score` + the auto-`label` tool still to build (annotate + replay
exist). First clip: `video-153822.mkv` (4 approach / 4 depart / 11 wave, with known
greet/goodbye misfires).

---

## Phase A — detailed

**Goal:** one resident process that owns the live hardware session and exposes
two independent toggles. No intelligence yet — prove the on/off plumbing and
lifecycle that B and C stand on.

**Layering** (keeps the architecture split):

- `session.py` stays the **hardware/transport primitive** — reused as-is.
- **New `reception.py`** = the **application control plane**. Holds a `Session`
  in-process and supervises two worker loops gated by toggles.

**Components:**

1. **`ReceptionDaemon`** — owns one `Session` + two flags (`vision_on`,
   `voice_on`) as an explicit state machine. Each toggle starts/stops **only its
   own** worker thread; never touches the other or tears down the shared session.
2. **Vision worker (stub in A)** — when `vision_on`, grab a frame every N s and
   log `frame ok WxH`. Detector/VLM come in Phase B.
3. **Voice worker (stub in A)** — when `voice_on`, drive the continuous-listen
   buffer and log a "listening tick." STT/brain come in Phase C.
4. **Control surface** — local Unix-socket + CLI extending the existing
   `serve`/`call` pattern: `status`, `vision on|off`, `voice on|off`,
   `shutdown`. (Network/Tailscale control endpoint deferred to E.)

**The risk Phase A exists to validate:** two loops sharing **one** WebRTC
session — grabbing camera frames and mic audio **concurrently** off a single
`ReachyMini()`. Continuous-listen already proves audio-while-busy; the new
combination is frame-grab + audio-grab at the same time. If stable, B and C are
unblocked.

**Deliverables:**

- `src/reachy_mini_brain/reception.py` (daemon + state machine + stub workers +
  control CLI)
- Socket-protocol extension for the toggle/status commands

**Test (run on the robot — hardware):**

1. `reception serve` → daemon up, both toggles off, session warm.
2. `vision on` → frame-ok logs; `voice on` → both ticking together (concurrency
   check).
3. `vision off` while voice stays on, and vice-versa → each stops independently,
   session stays alive.
4. `shutdown` → clean teardown (`media_manager.close()` + `disconnect()`).

---

## Decisions — resolved & still open

**Resolved:**
- **Local detector** → **RF-DETR Nano** (Apache-2.0; chosen over AGPL-licensed YOLO).
- **Alert channel** → **robot reacts on-device** (look + antenna flick + speak).
- **Agentic brain** → **`claude -p` headless agent, Haiku** (a real agent with
  built-in session management + Claude Code auth; over a raw Messages loop).
- **Tiering** → cheap detector continuous, VLM-on-event later; MVP is detector-only
  ("someone approaching" → greet).

**Still open:**
- **Local VLM** (tier-2 scene description) — small VLM (Florence-2 / Moondream) on
  events; not needed for the MVP. Phase B+.
- **FAQ knowledge** — currently facts-in-persona (Haiku drifts); add an authoritative
  FAQ tool. Phase C polish.
- **STT — VAD endpointing DONE; model replacement is the NEXT STT work.** (updated 2026-06-11)
  Added a
  **Silero-VAD endpointer** so each turn is one clean utterance — fixed the fragment/15s-garble problem
  (live-validated); bumped to faster-whisper `medium`. But `medium` is **batch + ~2s/utterance** and
  still fumbles short/fast/mumbled speech → off replies, so **STT is now the bottleneck.** Replacement
  candidates (detail + table in `voice-ai-research.md`): **(1) quick offline A/B** rerun faster-whisper
  `medium` vs `large-v3` vs `large-v3-turbo` on the clearer Haiku review clips
  (`20260610-145250-1a7624`, especially 03/04 split-turn + 05/06/13 transcript issues); do **not**
  score STT quality on the choppy GPT-OSS run. **(2) real fix** `parakeet-mlx` (NVIDIA Parakeet on
  Apple Silicon, ~80 ms local, accurate, private); **(3) cloud** AssemblyAI (noise-robust + intelligent
  endpointing). Also added **`--save-turns`** debug capture (per-turn WAV + heard/reply) to attribute off
  replies to STT vs brain. *(Current lean: try `large-v3-turbo` and `large-v3` first, then parakeet-mlx.)*
- **Conversation STARTUP lag — the lag that matters.** The serious lag is **wave → reaction**
  (the opener / conversation init), NOT between turns — per-turn lag (~3s) is acceptable for a
  first pass. Startup ≈ ~4s: alert poll + opener TTS (synth + ~1.3s buffer cushion + ~2.5s
  sentence playback). Fix candidates: pre-synth opener (done — cached), a **shorter opener**
  and/or an **instant non-verbal ack** (antenna flick) before the verbal line, trim the opener
  buffer cushion. (Logs confirm per-turn ≈ 3s regardless of process model — i.e. it's the
  model/CLI call, not spawn; the persistent brain doesn't move it.)
- **Brain persona too rigid (DEFERRED).** Replies act like a "stupid robot" — too rigid /
  deflecting / repetitive, not human-like. Loosen the persona (warmer, more natural, less
  scripted) — Phase C polish. **Memory across a short conversation is REQUIRED (non-negotiable):**
  the brain keeps **one persistent `claude -p` process (stream-json) per conversation** so it
  remembers the turns — do NOT revert to a stateless/per-turn model.
- **Approach/depart robustness — candidate fixes (NOT committed; validate offline first).**
  Aimed at the live false-greets: sitting still, small body movements, and edge-of-frame
  in/out flicker all tripping greet. Three options, cheapest first:
  - **`DetectionsSmoother(length=N)`** (supervision 0.28, already a dep — same lib as our
    `ByteTrack`, zero new deps) — averages box xyxy + confidence over the last N frames per
    `tracker_id`; smooths the area signal that's crossing our greet threshold. Additive,
    low-risk (~3 lines in `approach.py`); cost is a small lag (~N/fps). *Cheapest / lowest-risk.*
  - **`PolygonZone`** (supervision 0.28) — reframe greet/depart as a tracked person entering/
    leaving a "near-desk" zone (stateless + debounce, no bespoke latch; excludes edge
    detections by construction). **Caveat that probably kills it:** the polygon is in *fixed
    pixel space*, but our camera is **head-mounted** — any head turn/track/reaction shifts the
    desk in the frame, so the zone stops meaning "the desk." Only viable with head-pose gating
    or a pose→pixel transform. Skeptical; parked.
  - **Monocular depth — `Depth Anything V2` Small** (open-source, in Apple's CoreML library;
    ~25–40 ms on Apple Silicon / our M1 Max, ~50 MB F16). Per-frame person *depth* → a
    shrinking depth = approaching, replacing the box-area-as-distance hack with a learned
    signal. **Best fit for the moving camera:** per-frame depth doesn't care that the head
    moved *within* a frame (the weakness that sank PolygonZone), and easily fits the 5 fps
    budget (200 ms/frame). Heavier than the supervision tools (a model + inference) but the
    most *principled* fix — the open-source echo of how Tesla FSD replaced hand-geometry with
    learned camera 3D (+ a big-model-labels-small-model data engine). *Most promising if
    box-area stays flaky.*
  - Either way: prove it on the recorded walk-up/walk-away clips via the **replay harness**
    before any live change. These are also the cheap deterministic *baseline that a future
    learned classifier (VLM-auto-labeled event data — discussed, not yet written up) would
    have to beat* — try cheap first.
- **Wave → conversation (Feature 2)** — **wired (first pass, 2026-06-08).** Detection
  (`gesture.py`, MediaPipe `Open_Palm`, live-validated 0.61–0.73) → `wave` event → alert engine
  maps **`wave → start_conversation`**: speak an opener ("Hi there! How can I help you today?")
  then start the voice/brain loop. **End = idle timeout (45s) OR a max-duration cap (120s)**,
  whichever first. (`reception converse` triggers it manually.) Needs `--brain` + a keychain-authed
  context for `claude -p` (the daemon run from tmux). **Interaction gate DONE:** while a conversation
  is active (`_conversation_mode`), `react`/`farewell` are suppressed in the daemon — so
  approach/depart can't greet/goodbye over the conversation; auto-resumes on close. **Open:** (a)
  min hand distance; (b) **idle-close is background-noise-vulnerable** — STT transcribes ambient
  sound as `heard`, resetting the idle timer, so a noisy room rides to the max cap. *Fix (v2 below).*
- **Speaker-aware conversation close (v2 — the proper noise fix).** Vision can't gate this (the
  robot hears omnidirectionally — a visitor can talk from behind it), and `faster-whisper` only
  transcribes (no speaker ID). Add a **speaker-embedding / diarization** step (pyannote /
  SpeechBrain ECAPA / Resemblyzer): on the first utterance capture the talker's **voice
  fingerprint**, then reset the idle timer **only when that voice speaks** → conversation closes
  N s after the *real talker's* last words, ignoring background noise. Lighter alt: the robot's
  **mic-array DOA** (`doa` → `{angle, speech_detected}`) to gate on the talker's direction /
  detected-speech. Pairs with the deferred STT/VAD work.
- **Head roll calibration — RESOLVED (2026-06-09).** Recalibrated via the Reachy app; commanding
  level now sits ~0° (was ~7.5°). `reset` confirmed deterministic (body yaw exact ±0.2°; head
  *orientation* ~±6–7° non-repeatable — use the **4×4-matrix API, not euler**, for pose work).
  See `docs/head-pose-calibration-notes.md`.
- **Health-check / heartbeat process (ops continuity)** — a lightweight, separate process
  (like the alert engine) that periodically (~30–60s) polls and **appends a timestamped status
  line to a health log** (`artifacts/logs/health-<ts>.log`): reception daemon up? robot REST
  `:8000` `state` (running/error + the error string)? session `connected` / `video_ready` /
  `audio_ready`? events.jsonl advancing? alert engine up? Purpose: a persistent health history
  so degradations/deaths leave a **timestamped trace** for continued ops — the gap we just hit
  (daemon died overnight, robot in a motor-error state, *no record of when or how*). Later:
  notify on state change (running→error) and/or auto-restart on defined failures (overlaps the
  Phase E reconnect/supervisor work). Phase E.
- **Remote control** — Tailscale-exposed control endpoint for staff. Phase E.

---

## Phase A — result (validated on hardware, 2026-06-04)

Ran from the **local dev machine** (same LAN as the robot at `192.168.1.165`,
`REACHY_HOST` pinned to the IP). All green:

- **Lifecycle** — daemon starts, WebRTC warms up (~60s), `reception daemon ready`.
- **REST sanity** — `state get-state` returns live robot state.
- **vision** — `vision on` → real 1080p frames (`frame ok (1080,1920,3)`) every 2s.
- **voice** — `voice on` → mic captured 5s and STT transcribed it (`voice: heard 5.0s: '…'`).
- **Concurrency (the core risk)** — frames + mic reads ran simultaneously off ONE
  healthy WebRTC session, no conflict/crash. **Cleared.**
- **Independent toggles** — `vision off` while voice stayed on, then `voice off`.
- **Clean shutdown** — workers stopped, session closed, socket removed, exited ~1s.

Testing moved to the **local dev machine** (not m1max): same LAN, direct, no ssh.
m1max sleeping mid-test once dropped the WebRTC session (benign, but a lesson).

## Follow-ups discovered

- **Brain must not sleep** — when m1max slept, the session dropped (Phase A has no
  reconnect; that's Phase E). For deployment, disable sleep (`pmset`/`caffeinate`).
- **Use `REACHY_HOST=<ip>`** — mDNS `reachy-mini.local` was flaky on the LAN; the IP
  is reliable. (The SDK's `ReachyMini()` still resolves `reachy-mini.local` internally
  — worked here, but worth parameterizing if it flakes.) See [[robot-connectivity]].
- **Robot IP is DHCP** (`192.168.1.165`) — set a router reservation for stability.
- **Daemon discards audio** — add a `--save-wav`/debug-dump to the voice worker so we
  can audit what the mic hears (test transcription was garbled — couldn't inspect).
- **Camera defaults to `ReachyMiniLiteCamSpecs`** (we're Wireless) — revisit in the
  resolution/spec pass; frames are fine at 1080p.
- **GStreamer dylib-lookup noise** in the log (`libpython3.12.dylib … no such file`) —
  cosmetic; video came up fine. Tidy later.

---

## Phase B — result (code-complete; mock + real-video validated, 2026-06-05)

Tiered, fully local. On-robot live test pending.
- `detector.py` — RF-DETR Nano person detection. ~40-65ms/frame warm; the confidence
  threshold filters weak partials (0.5 dropped a low-confidence hand).
- `approach.py` — supervision **ByteTrack** + approach-vs-transit geometry (box-area
  growth + dwell, latched per track). Synthetic approacher fires; passer-by doesn't.
- `perception.py` — full pipeline → `artifacts/events.jsonl`. Whole stack ran on
  `reachy_video.mp4` (150 frames, 1080p) at **~23 fps**, no errors.
- `alert_engine.py` — separate process: tails the event log, applies the arrival rule
  + cooldown, sends `react` to the daemon. Mock loop: approach event → robot greets.
- `reception.py` — `serve --perception` runs the pipeline in the vision worker; a
  `react` command makes the robot greet (look + antenna flick + speak).

## Phase C — result (code-complete; mock + text validated, 2026-06-05)

`claude -p` agent, Haiku. On-robot live test pending.
- `brain.py` — `ReceptionBrain`: `claude -p --model haiku` with a receptionist persona.
  Clean-receptionist recipe: `--system-prompt <persona>` + `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`
  (every turn) + `--tools ""` + a neutral cwd + an anchored persona — these fixed the
  coding-agent bleed. Continuity = capture `session_id` on turn 1, `--resume` after.
- **Conversation boundary** = idle window (`conversation_timeout`, default 120s): a
  longer silence starts a fresh session ("new visitor").
- Wired into the voice worker via `serve --brain`: `listen → brain.respond() → speak`.
  Mock full-loop validated. ~2-4s, ~$0.01 per turn (Haiku, cached).
- **TTS** = Piper, default voice `en_US-lessac-medium`. **STT** = faster-whisper.

### Phase C auth — claude-on-m1max (the real blocker, now pinned down)

`claude -p`'s OAuth token (from `/login`) lives in the **macOS login Keychain**, readable
only by the **GUI session** — a headless/SSH/`nohup` process gets *"Not logged in"* (confirmed:
a login shell doesn't fix it; `~/.claude.json` is config-only). Since the daemon is launched
headless, `brain.py → claude -p` fails in deployment, not just in testing.
- **Dev workaround (works now):** a GUI-rooted **tmux session `claude-test`** keeps keychain
  access; `tmux send-keys` into it runs `claude -p` authenticated even over SSH (verified
  `OK`/exit 0). To run the *daemon's* brain this way, start `serve` from inside that session
  so its `claude -p` subprocess inherits the context.
- **Caveat:** the tmux session dies on m1max reboot / GUI logout → fragile for 24/7.
- **Production options (decide before deploy):** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (headless-robust, API
  billing) or **OpenRouter** (OpenAI-compatible; would replace the `claude -p` shell-out with
  an API call in `brain.py`). Both bypass the keychain entirely.

## Combined live test (pending — needs the robot)

On the brain machine, robot up + same LAN, camera at the room:
`serve --perception --brain` + `alert_engine`; `vision on`, `voice on`; walk up →
robot greets (B); talk → it converses (C). Prereq on the brain machine:
`uv pip install -e ".[vision]"` (rfdetr + supervision) and the `claude` CLI authed.
